# Customer Behavior Analysis – Data Analyst Portfolio Project

## Project Overview
This project presents an end-to-end customer behavior analysis using retail transactional data from 3,900 customer purchases. The objective is to analyze customer demographics, purchasing patterns, subscription behavior, discount usage, and product performance to generate actionable insights that support business decision-making.

The project simulates a real-world data analytics workflow, covering data preparation, SQL-based analysis, and interactive dashboard development using Power BI.

## Business Problem
A retail company wants to better understand how customers shop across demographics, product categories, and purchase conditions such as discounts, subscriptions, and shipping types.

**Core business question:**

How can customer shopping data be used to identify trends, improve customer engagement, and optimize marketing and product strategies?

---

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python (Pandas)** – data loading, cleaning, and feature engineering  
- **MySQL** – relational database storage and analytical SQL queries  
- **Power BI** – interactive dashboard and KPI visualization  
- **GitHub** – version control and project documentation

## Dataset Summary
- Total Records: 3,900  
- Total Columns: 18  

### Key Data Features
- Customer demographics: age, gender, age group, location  
- Purchase details: item purchased, category, purchase amount, season  
- Behavioral metrics: previous purchases, purchase frequency  
- Engagement factors: subscription status, discount applied, shipping type  
- Customer feedback: review rating, payment method  

Missing values in the review rating column were handled during data preparation.

## Data Preparation (Python)
The following steps were performed using Python:
- Loaded raw CSV data into a Pandas DataFrame  
- Performed initial exploration using `.info()` and `.describe()`  
- Handled missing review ratings using median imputation by product category  
- Standardized column names to snake_case  
- Created engineered features such as age_group and purchase_frequency_days  
- Removed redundant columns  
- Loaded the cleaned dataset into a MySQL database for SQL analysis  

---

## SQL Analysis Performed
Analytical SQL queries were written to answer key business questions, including:
- Total revenue generated by gender  
- Customers who used discounts but spent above the average purchase amount  
- Top 5 products by average review rating  
- Comparison of average purchase amount by shipping type  
- Spending and revenue comparison between subscribed and non-subscribed customers  
- Products with the highest discount utilization  
- Customer segmentation into New, Returning, and Loyal groups  
- Top 3 most purchased products within each category  
- Relationship between repeat buyers and subscription status  
- Revenue contribution by age group  

All queries are documented in the SQL file included in the repository.

## Power BI Dashboard
An interactive Power BI dashboard was created using data imported directly from the MySQL database.

### Key KPIs Displayed
- Number of Customers  
- Average Purchase Amount  
- Average Review Rating  
- Discount Utilization Percentage  

### Dashboard Visuals
- Customer distribution by subscription status  
- Revenue by product category  
- Sales volume by product category  
- Revenue by age group  
- Sales count by age group  

### Interactive Filters
- Subscription status  
- Gender  
- Category  
- Shipping type  

The dashboard enables stakeholders to explore customer behavior dynamically across different segments.

---

## Key Insights
- Subscribed customers contribute a significant share of total revenue  
- Clothing and Accessories categories generate the highest sales and revenue  
- Discount utilization varies by product, indicating different levels of price sensitivity  
- Young Adult and Middle-aged customers contribute the highest revenue  
- Repeat buyers show a higher likelihood of subscription  

---

## Business Recommendations
- Promote subscription benefits to increase recurring revenue  
- Introduce loyalty programs to convert returning customers into loyal customers  
- Optimize discount strategies for highly discount-dependent products  
- Highlight top-rated and best-selling products in marketing campaigns  
- Focus targeted marketing efforts on high-revenue age groups
