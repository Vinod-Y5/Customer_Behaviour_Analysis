# Customer Behavior Analysis – Data Analyst Portfolio Project

## Project Overview
This project presents an end-to-end customer behavior analysis using retail transactional data from 3,900 customer purchases. The objective is to analyze customer demographics, purchasing patterns, subscription behavior, discount usage, and product performance to generate actionable insights for business decision-making.

The project follows a complete data analytics workflow, including data preparation in Python, analytical querying using SQL, and interactive dashboard development in Power BI.

## Business Problem
A retail company wants to better understand how customers shop across demographics, product categories, and purchasing conditions such as discounts, subscriptions, and shipping types.

**Core business question:**

How can customer shopping data be used to identify trends, improve customer engagement, and optimize marketing and product strategies?

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas) – data loading, cleaning, and feature engineering  
- MySQL – relational database storage and SQL-based analysis  
- Power BI – interactive dashboard and KPI visualization  
- GitHub – version control and project documentation  

---

## Dataset Summary
- Total Records: 3,900  
- Total Columns: 18  

### Key Data Features
- Customer demographics: age, gender, age group, location  
- Purchase details: item purchased, category, purchase amount, season  
- Behavioral metrics: previous purchases, purchase frequency  
- Engagement factors: subscription status, discount applied, shipping type  
- Customer feedback: review rating, payment method  

Missing values in the review rating column were handled during data preparation.

## Data Preparation (Python)
The following steps were performed using Python and Pandas:
- Loaded raw dataset into a DataFrame  
- Performed initial exploration using `.info()` and `.describe()`  
- Handled missing values in review ratings using median imputation by product category  
- Standardized column names to snake_case  
- Created engineered features such as age_group and purchase_frequency_days  
- Removed redundant columns  
- Loaded the cleaned dataset into a MySQL database for SQL analysis  

---

## SQL Analysis Performed
SQL queries were used to answer key business questions, including:
- Total revenue generated by gender  
- Customers who used discounts but spent above average  
- Top 5 products by average review rating  
- Comparison of average purchase amount by shipping type  
- Spending and revenue comparison between subscribed and non-subscribed customers  
- Products with the highest discount utilization  
- Customer segmentation into New, Returning, and Loyal groups  
- Top 3 most purchased products within each category  
- Relationship between repeat buyers and subscription status  
- Revenue contribution by age group  

---

## Power BI Dashboard
An interactive Power BI dashboard was created using data imported directly from the MySQL database.

### Key KPIs Displayed
- Number of Customers  
- Average Purchase Amount  
- Average Review Rating  
- Discount Utilization Percentage  

### Dashboard Visuals
- Customer distribution by subscription status  
- Revenue by product category  
- Sales volume by product category  
- Revenue by age group  
- Sales count by age group  

### Interactive Filters
- Subscription status  
- Gender  
- Category  
- Shipping type  

The dashboard allows stakeholders to explore customer behavior dynamically and identify patterns across different segments.

## Key Insights
- Subscribed customers contribute a significant share of total revenue  
- Certain product categories dominate both revenue and sales volume  
- Discount usage varies by product, indicating differing price sensitivity  
- Young Adult and Middle-aged customer groups generate the highest revenue  
- Repeat buyers show higher likelihood of subscription  

---

## Business Recommendations
- Promote subscription benefits to increase recurring revenue  
- Introduce loyalty programs for repeat customers  
- Optimize discount strategies for highly discount-dependent products  
- Highlight top-rated and best-selling products in marketing campaigns  
- Focus targeted marketing on high-revenue age groups

## Project Outcome
This project demonstrates the ability to:
- Perform structured data cleaning and feature engineering  
- Write analytical SQL queries to answer real business questions  
- Build KPIs aligned with stakeholder needs  
- Design an interactive and professional Power BI dashboard  
- Communicate insights and recommendations clearly
